Oren Peli first thought of the idea for the story when he saw a photo blog posted by a girl traveling through Pripyat on a motorcycle [elenafilatova.com].   
    The film was shot on location in Hungary and Serbia.   
    Real Ukranian tours to Prypiat and Chernobyl can be booked online for under 100 USD.   
    Not screened in advance for critics.   
    According to Reuters at least 1 organization has tried to use the film to raise awareness and funding for children of the disaster. Producer Peli is pleased with that but divulges "I'm not going to pretend that was my main goal - my main goal was to create a movie that people will find entertaining and scary and will enjoy it."   
    Writer/Producer Oren Peli - who also created Paranormal Activity - strongly defends this movie against claims it was insensitive to a devastating disaster saying "I found it very sad and fascinating and eerie and creepy... I thought it would be a great setting for a scary horror film. It was never our intention to offend anyone."   
    After the end credits the final sound the viewer hears is a rapidly clicking Geiger counter indicating high radiation.   
    Jonathan Sadowski and Jesse McCartney have since worked together in the sitcom Young and Hungry.  ]
