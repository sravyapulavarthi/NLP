This hairy breed was originally bred in Hungary and was used to guard the flocks of sheep there.
This history makes them excellent guard dogs for homes and families in modern times.
They take a good deal of training and their signature coat takes regular grooming, but they can become loyal and obedient pets.
Komondors are related to the Pulis, are descended from Russian stock, and may be among the oldest of the dog breeds.
These large dogs are very protective of their homes and owners and also receive a lot of attention at competitive dog shows.
